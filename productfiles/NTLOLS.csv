Our many years of experience provides the foundation for this combined with the relentless drive to further develop our expertise in all relevant areas. Our customers can tell the quality of our laminate floors by the brilliance of our decors as well as by the particularly good anti-swelling behaviour of the core boards and the perfect click connections. These properties characterise the faultless appearance of the Parador installation over the long term.,"The elaborately reproduced decor papers based on organic dyes
are made with innovative printing methods and guarantee an unsurpassed
brilliance of colour. The latest computer-controlled profiling
machines ensure the highest fitting accuracy and thus enable a
perfect click connection, which guarantees a joint that is almost
imperceptible to the eye. This creates a uniform look, whilst dirt and
damp are less able to penetrate the floor, making cleaning considerably
easier. In order to be able to guarantee these and other qualities
for every single plank of laminate flooring, the whole production
process is continually subject to quality control procedures.",,Germany,1285mm,194mm,na,8mm,,,,19 Kg,10,This type of flooring can be floated over any level hard surface throughout your home.
