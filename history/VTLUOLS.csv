"Floating Floor Underlay",DU1133,173,Dunlop,"Dunlop Timbercushion is a specialist timber flooring underlay that provides acoustic performance whilst offering effective moisture protection. Dunlop Timbercushion is recommended for use with most common laminate, engineered wood and solid timber floating floors where superior noise reduction, effective moisture protection and resilience is required.","Recently the Building Code of Australia (BCA) ame nded
the minimum sound insulation requirements for multi-level
dwellings to reect community expectations. The BCA
standard requires that all flooring assemblies be te sted
to determine their acoustic performance.
The acoustic performance is measured in terms
Ln,w + CI that describe the Impact Sound Insulation.
The minimum requirement as set by the BC6A2 i ds B.
The lower the dB result for the flooring assembly t he
better the acoustic performance of the floor.
All of Dunlop Flooring’s timber underlays have gone through
extensive testing by the CSIRO to determine their acoustic
performance and compliance with the standard set by the
BCA. Dunlop’s timber flooring underlays all exceed the
standard.",,,"20 ln mtrs/roll",1600mm,3mm,,,,,,6.90,DU1133_V,DU1133_L,DU1133_S,

"Floating Floor Underlay",IL3202,"6,273",Instafloor,"InstaLay* is a self-contained underlay system that
simplifies installation by reducing sub-floor preparation
and eliminating the need for adhesive. InstaLay adds
comfort and sound absorption to improve the performance
of common floor covering products in private homes,
hospitality, retail, healthcare, multi-family housing,
education facilities and more.
The InstaLay system has the benefit of being supported
internally by recycled vulcanized rubber crumb granules,
unlike traditional foam and textile underlays. Therefore
when InstaLay is compressed the rubber granules provide
excellent cushioning performance, but when the pressure
is released these granules immediately return to their
original shape. In addition to being non-collapsing,
they will not degrade over time and have excellent
acoustic properties.","InstaLay 30lg
3mm underlay with non-permanent self-adhesive bond
(low grab). Ideal for carpet tiles, LVT’s (click joint) with a
thickness of ≥ 3.0mm engineered wood (click joint) and
laminate (click joint) installations.","Loose lay installation, without wet adhesives, for rapid
fitting and easy future lifting
 Can be installed over existing flooring without
causing damage
 Significantly reduces sub-floor preparation times as
screeds or smoothing compounds are often not required
 Quick to fit, easy to work with – no messy adhesives in
contact with the floor covering
 Forgives minor sub-floor imperfections
 Low VOC’s for a healthier environment
 Can be used with underfloor heating
 Polypropylene membrane prevents plasticiser
migration between vinyl and rubber
 Eliminates adhesive open time delays and early/late
placement problems
 No adhesive and no nails for wood flooring
 Non-allergenic and anti-microbial
 No wait time to walk on after installation is complete
 Manufactured using recycled rubber crumb to
provide long lasting acoustic performance
 Environmentally friendly and fully recyclable
 Resistant to mould, mildew and decay",,"15ln mtrs/roll",1000mm,3mm,,,,,,16,IL3202_V,IL3202_L,IL3202_S,
