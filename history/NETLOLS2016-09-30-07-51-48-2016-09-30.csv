trends. This Mega board suits todays open planned living spaces and creates a visual second to none. 
The range includes authentic imitations of quality timbers all in many
different plank formats, surface textures and a four sided V joint groove. The ideal basis
for a design-oriented furnishing style.","Laminate flooring has long since freed itself from its natural predecessors, engineered wood and solid
wood flooring – not least because of its high resilience and easy maintenance, which also makes it
suitable for heavy duty demands in intensively used rooms. These days laminate flooring is experiencing a
higher level of appreciation than ever and is seen as a worthy alternative to real wood floors. Laminate
flooring from Parador is accorded a special role in this development. Due to our wealth of experience with
wood and the latest technical expertise, we are in a position to produce authentic interpretations of high
quality timbers and also transform other classic materials like stone and concrete into laminate flooring
realistically.","The elaborately reproduced decor papers based on organic dyes
are made with innovative printing methods and guarantee an unsurpassed
brilliance of colour. The latest computer-controlled profiling
machines ensure the highest fitting accuracy and thus enable a
perfect click connection, which guarantees a joint that is almost
imperceptible to the eye. This creates a uniform look, whilst dirt and
damp are less able to penetrate the floor, making cleaning considerably
easier. In order to be able to guarantee these and other qualities
for every single plank of laminate flooring, the whole production
process is continually subject to quality control procedures.",,Germany,2200mm,243mm,na,9mm,,,,23,5,"This type of flooring can be floated over any level hard surface throughout your home.
